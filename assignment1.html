    <h1>Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</h1>
    Here is an example of horizontal rule:<br>
    <hr>
    To begin, we can change the 
    <h2>header size</h2>
    and <span style="color:blue">color</span> <span style="color:red">of</span>
     <span style="color:lightblue">letters</span> seen on the screen. The <big><b>font size</b></big>
        can be changed as <br> well, and actually gives more choices.<br>
        We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing<br> word types 
        in a blocked quote.<br><br>
        Now is the time for all good <b>people</b> to <b>come</b> to the aid of their country.<br>
        This was also an example of nested command.
